# OPML Blogroll
A WordPress plugin that exposes the internal Link Manager links as an OPML file at `/.well-known/recommendations.opml`, adds a link element with `rel="blogroll"` to the `<head>` section to aid discovery, and adds a `source:blogroll` to your RSS feed generated for you by WordPress as per the ['source' namespace](https://source.scripting.com/#1710035563000).

# Example
You can see OPML Blogroll working its magic here: https://hammyhavoc.com/.well-known/recommendations.opml, which exposes https://hammyhavoc.com/following/ as a `.opml` file.
