# OPML Blogroll
A WordPress plugin that exposes the internal Link Manager links as an OPML file at `/.well-known/recommendations.opml`, adds a link element with `rel="blogroll"` to the `<head>` section to aid discovery as per the [`source` namespace](https://source.scripting.com/#1710035563000), and adds a `source:blogroll` to your RSS feed generated for you by WordPress.

Based on the work of [Josh Betz](https://josh.blog/2024/05/blogrolls).
