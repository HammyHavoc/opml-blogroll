# OPML Blogroll
A WordPress plugin that exposes the internal Link Manager links at `/.well-known/recommendations.opml`, adds a link element with `rel="blogroll"` to the `<head>` section, adds a `source:blogroll` to your RSS feed.

Based on the work of [Josh Betz](https://josh.blog/2024/05/blogrolls).
